## **Overview**

The Daopia Frontend is a user-friendly interface designed to interact with the **[Daopia platform](https://github.com/grandzero/daopia)**. Built with Next.js, it allows users to connect their wallets, view DAOs registered on Daopia, join them through payments, download exclusive files, and contribute by uploading files and creating contribution proposals.

This project is based on the boilerplate found here: **[nexth boilerplate](https://github.com/wslyvh/nexth)**.

## **Features**

- **View DAOs**: Users can view all DAOs registered on Daopia once they connect their wallets.
- **Join DAOs**: Users can make payments to join DAOs and gain access to exclusive content.
- **Download Files**: Members of a DAO can download files that are exclusive to the DAO members.
- **Contribute to DAOs**: Users can upload files and create contribution proposals to contribute to the DAOs.
- **Proposal List**: The proposal list is fetched with the help of Tableland.

## **Future Updates**

In upcoming versions, the DAO registration system will be activated, and more features will be added to enhance the user experience.
